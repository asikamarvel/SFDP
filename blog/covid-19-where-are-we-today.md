As the world battles with the novel coronavirus, some countries are yet to report cases, some are trying to bend the curve as they approach the peak, some have reached or past the peak, while others are experiencing a second wave of the infections. Researchers are working tirelessly to produce medications or vaccinations against the virus. Information circulating on the internet shows that a greater part of the world population is skeptical about vaccinations, possible side effects of vaccines, and how it might disrupt their daily lives.

 The following medications have shown a positive outcome in reducing the symptoms of the virus and are used in the treatment regimen:

1\. Remdesivir  
2\. Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine  
3\. Azithromycin  
4\. Convalescent plasma  
5\. Actemra (tocilizumab)  
6\. Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir)  
7\. Tamiflu (oseltamivir)  
8\. Avigan (favipiravir)  
9\. Colcrys (colchicine)  
10\. Ivermectin

These medications have toxic effects and should not be taken without consulting with your doctor first. Media report shows that some people have lost their lives due to self-medication. Various pharmaceutical companies are coming up with vaccines that are still under clinical trials. There is no vaccine available yet for the treatment of COVID-19 as of May 25, 2020.

While we hope for the best, it has become certain that our lives would never return to normal and so it is paramount that we adhere to regulations. The travel industry across the world has come to a hurt over the past months, but there might be some adjustment made towards the end of the year. Let us be our brother’s keeper, be kind, and inform the right authorities if you think you are showing symptoms of the coronavirus infection.
