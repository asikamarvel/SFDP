#### **Sometimes our body whispers and does not scream**

Some of the most dangerous diseases in the world do not come with the symptoms we know, such as pain, fevers, or rashes. They arrive quietly and damage the body in silence. Many people wait until a disease brings discomfort before taking it seriously, but reality tells a different story. A large number of individuals are walking around with underlying medical conditions they have no idea exist, until it is too late. Let me walk you through some of these conditions and help you to understand when the body whispers.

#### **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): The Silent Killer**

One of the most common silent threats is high blood pressure (HBP), also called hypertension. Generally, HBP is referred to as the “[silent killer](https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/hypertension-the-silent-killer/2024/05)” because it rarely shows symptoms in its early stages. A person can have high blood pressure for years without knowing. This silent pressure strains the heart, blood vessels, brain, and kidneys. To spark your curiosity, do you know that over 1.28 billion adults globally have hypertension, and nearly half of them are unaware of it? This is according to the recent report from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension). If HBP is left unchecked, it can result in a heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure without prior warning.

#### **Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM) - Type 2 diabetes.**

Similar to HBP, [type 2 diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html) often begins without any noticeable signs. The body may seem perfect while still struggling to regulate blood sugar. Conventionally, the body uses insulin to transport sugar (glucose) from the bloodstream into the cells for proper functioning. When the body cannot keep up with this task, or does not produce enough insulin, glucose builds up in the blood and less in the cells, leading to high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) and impaired cellular function. Over time, the condition can damage nerves, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels. Most times, fatigue, blurry vision, or frequent urination can occur, but many people miss or dismiss these body whispers. As stated by the [International Diabetes Federation](https://idf.org/about-diabetes/diabetes-facts-figures/), more than 240 million people globally have diabetes and do not even know it. It is a slow but serious condition that is best managed when caught early.

#### **Chronic Kidney Disease**

[Chronic kidney disease (CKD)](https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/chronic-kidney-disease-ckd) is another major concern that advances silently. The kidneys filter waste from the blood, ensure fluid balance, and manage blood pressure. However, the kidney function can deteriorate without causing pain or showing noticeable signs. By the time symptoms such as swelling, fatigue, or changes in urination appear, severe damage may already have occurred.

#### **Breast Cancer: the stealthy invader**

In addition to the above-highlighted conditions, some forms of cancer can go unnoticed in the early stages, particularly [breast cancer](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breast-cancer-in-women/). In contrast to popular belief, not all breast cancers begin with a lump or visible change in the breast. In fact, early breast cancer often causes no pain at all. Many women discover it accidentally during a routine check or screening. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/breast-cancer) notes that breast cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer globally, and to improve the survival rate, early detection is paramount. Regular self-exams, mammograms, and clinical screenings are essential, especially if there is a family history.

#### **The Liver saboteur: Fatty Liver Disease**

[Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/) (NAFLD) is another increasingly common but overlooked condition. It happens when fat builds up in the liver, even if you do not consume alcohol. NAFLD is strongly linked to obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. In some instances, high cholesterol or [high triglyceride levels](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/high-blood-triglycerides) can be a factor.  Most people have no symptoms in the early stages. Some may notice fatigue or a feeling of fullness in the upper abdomen, but many only find out when they undergo tests for something else. Alarmingly, NAFLD affects around one in three adults worldwide and can progress to cirrhosis or liver cancer if it is not treated, according to the [American Liver Foundation.](https://liverfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAFLD-At-A-Glance-2015.pdf)

#### **What can we do to identify the whispers of our body?**

It is worth noting that prevention begins with awareness. Just because you feel fine does not mean everything is fine. The magic ear that hears the whispers of our body is regular check-ups. Even when we have no symptoms, regular check-ups are vital to staying healthy. Monitoring the blood pressure, blood sugar, weight, kidney function, and liver enzymes helps catch problems before they become serious. Many of these diseases are manageable if they are diagnosed early.

It is also important to understand that genetics and lifestyle hold the spotlight in the risk for these conditions. So, knowing the family history, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding harmful habits like smoking or excessive alcohol intake are turning points toward prevention.

#### **Final thoughts**

The disease you might already have, and not know, could be silently progressing. But you are not powerless. By becoming more proactive about your health, you can shift from reactive treatment to preventive care, and of course, prevention is better than a cure. Do not wait for symptoms to show before you pay attention to your health. Sometimes, the most dangerous illness is the one you never knew was there.

Your body may not always shout when something is wrong; sometimes it only whispers. Are you listening?
