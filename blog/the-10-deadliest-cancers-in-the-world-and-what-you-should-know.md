The word “cancer” feels heavy and emotional. Many have lost parents, siblings, friends, or loved ones to this disease. It causes pain that medication can't fully ease. Families watch their loved ones weaken, and treatment often demands more strength and money than many can provide. Yet, amidst our fears, there's a comforting truth: knowledge can save lives! When people understand what makes cancer dangerous, recognize the warning signs, and know the sources of risk, more lives can be protected.

#### How deadly is cancer globally?

Cancer is now responsible for [an estimated 9.7 million deaths per year worldwide, and about one in nine men and one in twelve women die from the disease](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services). The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) estimated around [20 million new cancer cases in 2022](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services), with ten major types responsible for roughly two-thirds of all deaths. [Lung cancer remains the top cause of cancer related deaths worldwide](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services), with colorectal, liver, breast, and stomach cancers also affecting many people around the globe.

Major factors that contribute to this burden include [population growth and aging, smoking and tobacco use, poor diets, obesity, alcohol consumption, and environmental hazards](https://www.uicc.org/news-and-updates/news/globocan-2022-latest-global-cancer-data-shows-rising-incidence-and-stark) such as air pollution. Nevertheless, treatment options and research have improved, but late diagnoses and disparities in healthcare access cause survival rates to differ between high- and low-income countries.

Here are the top 10 deadliest cancers based on annual global deaths, starting from number 10 and ranking up to the number-one killer, using 2022 data from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)](https://gco.iarc.fr/en).

### 10\. Cancer of the blood (Leukemia) with over 300,000 deaths/year

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-12.52.53.jpeg)

Leukemia affects blood-forming tissues, mainly the bone marrow. With leukemia, abnormal white blood cells displace normal blood cells and weaken the immune system. Because cancer cells circulate in the bloodstream from the beginning, leukemia affects the entire body rather than forming a single solid tumor. Globally, leukemia is estimated to cause around [3% of all cancer deaths](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560490/), with approximately [300,000 deaths each year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560490/). Symptoms such as fatigue, fevers, night sweats, bone pain, frequent infections, and easy bruising can be mistaken for minor illnesses, which leads to delays in diagnosis.

Despite this, progress in treatments like chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, and newer options like [CAR-T cell therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/car-t-cells) has reduced the mortality rate [by about 1.5% annually over the past decade](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560490/), according to data from the [Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database](https://seer.cancer.gov/). Risk factors for leukemia include radiation, benzene exposure, and genetic conditions such as Down syndrome.

### 9\. Cervical cancer, a preventable killer in women.

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-12.57.01-e1765213168512.jpeg)

The cervix connects the uterus (womb) to the vagina. Cervical cancer develops in the cells of the cervix, often [after a long-lasting infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer), especially types 16 and 18. It ranks as the [fourth most common cancer among women](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer) worldwide and leads to about [350,000 deaths](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer) each year. Sadly, most of these deaths happen in low- and middle-income countries, where access to HPV vaccination, Pap smears, and HPV testing is limited.

One concerning fact is that early-stage cervical cancer often shows no symptoms, which means many women feel healthy until the disease advances. At later stages of the cancer development, a few signs appear, including;

- abnormal vaginal bleeding,

- bleeding after sex,

- pelvic pain,

- discomfort during intimacy.

Risk factors of cervical cancer include immunosuppression, for example, in HIV. [Women living with HIV are six times more likely to develop cervical cancer than women without HIV](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer). Other factors are smoking, high parity (many full-term pregnancies), long-term use of oral contraceptives, and lack of screening.

### 8\. Prostate cancer is common in men

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-13.10.52-e1765213537115.jpeg)

Prostate cancer kills [approximately 400,000 men](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/17/2/194) worldwide each year. It develops in the prostate gland, an organ situated below the bladder that produces seminal fluid. [Seminal fluid primarily aids the transportation of sperm to the oocyte for fertilization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216625384). Prostate cancer differs from benign prostate enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH). BPH is a non-cancerous increase in the size of the prostate where normal cells multiply and press on the urethra, [causing urinary symptoms, but never spreading to other parts of the body](https://www.advancedurology.com/blog/different-symptoms-of-bph-vs-prostate-cancer). The real danger comes when cancer cells escape the prostate gland and spread to the bones or other organs, which is most often seen in prostate cancer. Both conditions can cause similar urinary problems, but [BPH does not turn into cancer](https://www.advancedurology.com/blog/different-symptoms-of-bph-vs-prostate-cancer).

Blood tests, [digital rectal exam](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045668&version=Patient&language=en), [prostate-specific antigen (PSA)](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046540&version=Patient&language=en) test, and a [urinalysis](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046641&version=Patient&language=en) can determine whether symptoms are caused by prostate cancer, a benign prostate condition, or other issues such as a [urinary tract infection (UTI)](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/urinary-tract-infection). Thus, PSA tests are routinely recommended for men aged 40 and older. The test tracks the progression of prostate cancer in men who have already been diagnosed, helps monitor prostate symptoms, and screens for prostate cancer in men without symptoms.

Older men are usually at greater risk. Obesity and diets rich in red or processed meat can also add to the risk. Individuals who are affected can experience signs, such as:

- difficulty initiating urination

- a weak urine flow

- urgent or frequent urge to urinate

- urinating multiple times during the night

- erectile dysfunction

- blood in urine or semen

- lower back pain and weight loss

### 7\. Pancreatic Cancer, with over 466,000 deaths annually

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-13.11.59-e1765214010125.jpeg)

Pancreatic cancer is the [fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK518996/). The death toll can be attributed to late diagnosis. Symptoms like jaundice, weight loss, or abdominal pain often appear only when the disease has already spread. Major risk factors are smoking, obesity, [chronic pancreatitis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-pancreatitis/), diabetes, and a family history of pancreatic cancer.

Although there is no guaranteed cure, with early diagnosis, the tumor can be removed by surgery before the cancer spreads.

### 6\. Esophageal Cancer

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-13.15.43.jpeg)

The 2020 GLOBOCAN data by IARC placed esophageal cancer [at over 540,000 deaths](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21660), while 2022 data recorded a decline in the [death toll to over 445,000](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21834). The cancer affects the food pipe and often begins silently. But as tumors grow, swallowing becomes painful and difficult. Other early symptoms are mild heartburn and indigestion.

There are two main groups:

- Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which occurs in the upper and middle parts of the esophagus.

- Adenocarcinoma, close to the stomach junction.

Associated risk factors include [genetics, chronic inflammation caused by smoking, hot beverages, heavy alcohol use, chronic acid reflux, and obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459267/).

### 5\. Stomach (Gastric) Cancer

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-13.10.03.jpeg)

Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, is another silent killer, reported to kill about [660,000 people in 2022](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21834). The cancer begins with abnormal cell growth in the stomach lining, and symptoms often mimic common digestive problems like indigestion or bloating. In the advanced stage, weight loss, vomiting of blood, and severe pain can be experienced. Risk factors include [Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2319417016000160), smoking, and diets high in salt. [About 850,000 stomach cancer cases each year are attributed to H. pylori infection](https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/global-cancer-facts-and-figures/global-cancer-facts-and-figures-2024.pdf).  
Targeted therapies and improved endoscopic techniques are helping, but the burden remains heavy. Drugs like [Trastuzumab and Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan, which target the growth-promoting protein (HER2)](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/stomach-cancer/treating/targeted-therapies.html), are making progress in the management of this cancer.

### 4\. Breast Cancer, common and deadly

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-13.16.05.jpeg)

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. In 2022, there were about [2.3 million new breast cancer cases and roughly 670,000 deaths globally](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services), accounting for about 15% of all female cancer deaths. Survival rates are high in developed countries due to access to [mammography screening](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/patient/breast-screening-pdq) and [targeted therapies like HER2 inhibitors](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/treatment/targeted-therapy-for-breast-cancer.html). Still, women in resource-limited regions often face late diagnoses and fewer treatment options. Regular mammography, clinical breast exams, and prompt evaluation of  
lumps are highly recommended, especially if you have a family history of breast cancer. Mutations in the BRCA genes, other gene mutations, obesity, hormone replacement therapies, and regular alcohol consumption are [risk factors](https://www.cdc.gov/breast-cancer/risk-factors/index.html).

### 3\. Liver Cancer

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-13.36.52.jpeg)

GLOBOCAN 2022 [estimates around 870,000 new liver cancer cases and about 760,000 deaths per year](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21834). It is strongly linked to [chronic hepatitis B and C infections, alcohol-related cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, aflatoxin-contaminated foods, and inherited or metabolic liver disorders](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21834). In many cases, patients are diagnosed late when treatment options are already limited. Preventive measures include [hepatitis B vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/vaccination/index.html) and antiviral therapies for hepatitis C.

### 2\. What is colorectal cancer?

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-13.27.01.jpeg)

Colorectal cancer affects the colon and rectum. It usually starts from precancerous [polyps](https://muschealth.org/medical-services/digestive/diseases/colon-ibs/polyps) that slowly turn into cancer if they are not treated. Colorectal cancer might not be making the headlines like breast and prostate cancers. However, it is still the [third most commonly diagnosed cancer at 1.9 million cases](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services), and the [second leading cause of cancer death worldwide at over 900,000 deaths](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services). Risk factors include diets high in red meat, obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and family history. Regular colonoscopy screenings and genetic testing are recommended, especially for individuals with a family history of the disease. Colonoscopy can help catch polyps early, preventing cancer altogether.

### 1\. Lung Cancer

![](https://s-fdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-13.27.27.jpeg)

Finally, lung cancer sits at the top of the list as the deadliest cancer in the world. It accounted for about [2.5 million new cases and roughly 1.8 million](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21834) deaths in 2022, [that’s around 18–19% of all cancer deaths](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21834) globally. About 80–90% of lung-cancer deaths are linked to preventable factors, particularly cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke. However, air pollution, exposure to radon gas, asbestos, and other occupational exposures also contribute.

Symptoms such as persistent cough, chest pain, and weight loss often appear only after the disease has advanced, making treatment difficult. However, treatment options such as surgery, radiotherapy, platinum-based chemotherapy, targeted therapies tailored to specific mutations (such as [EGFR](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/symptoms-diagnosis/biomarker-testing/egfr), [ALK](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/symptoms-diagnosis/biomarker-testing/alk-lung-cancer), and [ROS1](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/symptoms-diagnosis/biomarker-testing/ros1)), and immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved outcomes for some patients.

#### Key Takeaway

If cancer is to be fought effectively, we need two things: awareness and early action. Many of the cancers listed above can be detected early through screening (for colorectal, breast, lung, and stomach cancers). Others require strong preventive measures, such as vaccinations (for hepatitis), lifestyle changes (quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising), and regular health check-ups. Cancer is not guaranteed death. But ignorance and delay give it the advantage.
