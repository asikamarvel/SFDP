Nutrition is essential in giving a child the best start in life. The first 1,000 days, from  
conception through a child’s second birthday, are a critical window that shapes lifelong  
health (1). What mothers eat during pregnancy and what babies consume in their early years  
has an impact on growth, brain development, and immunity (2). Although these early days  
are vital, good nutrition continues to matter far beyond the 1,000-day mark.

### Why the First 1,000 Days Matter

During this period, the brain develops at an extraordinary pace, organs mature, and  
immunity is built (7). When there are nutrient deficiencies, such as a lack of protein, iron,  
folate, or healthy fats, the consequences may include stunted growth, reduced cognitive  
ability, and greater vulnerability to disease (5)(6)(7). The WHO reported that, globally in  
2022, an estimated 149 million children under the age of five were stunted, primarily due  
to poor nutrition and inadequate care in early life (1).

### Nutrition During Pregnancy

The very first step towards a healthy child starts during pregnancy. The nutrients consumed  
during this time directly impact a baby’s overall health. For example, folic acid reduces the  
risk of neural tube defects, iron lowers the chance of anemia, and omega-3 fatty acids  
support healthy brain and eye development (8). The U.S. government's dietary guidelines  
can help build a healthy eating routine during pregnancy. Access and equity issues are  
important here, as not all women have equal access to nutrient-rich foods or supplements,  
particularly in low-resource areas. Factors such as poverty, food insecurity, cultural  
practices, and limited healthcare access can affect maternal and child nutrition (1). Thus,  
fortified foods (9) and social support systems, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition  
Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), are essential in closing these gaps to  
ensure every child has a fair start in life.

### Breastfeeding and Formula Feeding

Breastfeeding is often described as a baby’s first vaccination. A newborn's immune system  
is strengthened by the nutrients, antioxidants, and antibodies found in breast milk.  
Breastfeeding should begin within an hour after birth, according to the WHO, as this lowers  
the risk of death from diarrhea and other diseases, which can increase in infants who are  
partially or not breastfed (10).

Meanwhile, to achieve optimal health and protection against gastrointestinal infections, the  
WHO and UNICEF recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of birth (3)  
(6). However, breastfeeding is not possible for every family. The best option in these  
situations is to use commercial infant formula that adheres to international safety and  
nutritional standards. These formulas provide infants with the proteins, carbohydrates, fats,  
vitamins, and minerals they need during the first year of life and are good alternatives for  
caregivers. For newborns with specific requirements, there are also specialized formulas  
available, such as hydrolyzed formulas for those who are allergic to cow's milk protein or  
soy-based formulas for families who prefer plant-based solutions (11). Guidelines on  
choosing the right formula for a baby can be accessed on the CDC website. It is advisable  
to avoid unsafe substitutes such as diluted cow’s milk, rice water, or homemade formula  
recipes, which can put babies at risk of infection (12).

### Complementary Feeding and Nutrition beyond the First 1,000 Days

Complementary Feeding and Nutrition beyond the First 1,000 Days  
Babies require more than breast milk or formula by the time they are six months old.  
Complementary feeding starts at this point. Nutrient-rich foods, such as [pureed vegetables,  
mashed fruits, fortified cereals](https://www.cdc.gov/infant-toddler-nutrition/foods-and-drinks/when-what-and-how-to-introduce-solid-foods.html), and protein sources, are recommended. Introducing a  
variety of nutritious meals helps babies develop healthy eating habits in the future. Unsafe  
practices, like offering sugary drinks or processed foods, should be avoided (13).  
Nutrition is vital during the first 1,000 days of life, but it remains crucial as children grow  
older. School-aged children and adolescents also require balanced diets for improved  
academic performance, energy, and long-term health. Investing in nutrition throughout life  
benefits individuals and society as a whole.

### What Families Can Do

- Ensure a balanced diet during pregnancy.

- Practice exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, or use safe formula feeding if needed.

- Introduce a variety of nutrient-rich complementary foods from six months onward.

- Avoid unsafe practices like early introduction of sugary drinks.

### Final Thoughts

The first 1,000 days are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set children on a healthy path.  
Providing a nutritious diet, whether through breastfeeding, formulas, or safe  
complementary food, can help each child reach their full potential. Although the 1000-day  
window is critical, the journey of nutrition does not stop there; healthy diets remain  
essential for every stage of life.
