## What is addiction, and what are the factors behind it?

Addiction is a condition characterized by a consistent urge and desire to engage in any activity or use a substance despite the harmful consequences. Some cases of addiction can be linked to [mental health, biological factors, the environment, and an individual’s lifestyle and experiences.](https://www.asam.org/quality-care/definition-of-addiction) Thus, these factors explain why addiction does not affect everyone the same way. Some people experiment with drugs or alcohol and walk away, while others quickly become dependent. Although the initial decision to take drugs is voluntary, the issue lies in the ability to show self-control. This inability to have self-control is the foundation of addiction, and if we want to fight it effectively, we must understand that it is not just about the substance; it is also about the person using it.

## What are the biological factors of addiction?

Genetics is the primary biological factor that increases a person’s risk of addiction. Just like one inherits eye color or blood type, and diseases like diabetes and cancer, a higher risk of addiction can also be inherited. [Research shows that up to 50% of a person’s risk of becoming addicted is linked to genetic factors.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8477224/) That means someone with a parent or sibling who struggles with substance abuse may have a higher chance of becoming addicted themselves, even if they are raised in a completely different environment.

## How mental health conditions affect addiction.

Many people who become addicted also live with underlying mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or [PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder)](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/overview/). A person with untreated depression might start using substances like alcohol, opioids, or stimulants to relieve emotional pain or to feel better. This can lead to repeated use and eventually cause dependence or addiction.

Thus, someone may be dealing with depression or anxiety while also struggling with alcohol or drug addiction. Subsequently, the two conditions can interact and worsen each other, a condition which is medically known as [dual diagnosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dual-diagnosis).

## How do environmental factors and early exposure contribute to addiction?

When someone grows up in an environment or from a family where the use of drugs and alcohol is normalized, it can increase the person’s risk of addiction, especially if they start using the substances at a young age. In a literal sense, a child who lives in a house of smoke will likely grow up coughing, and habits are usually caught and not taught.

Also, the brain is still developing in childhood and adolescence, making it more vulnerable to substances that change brain chemistry. Other environmental factors include;

- Peer pressure from the place of work, the pressure to improve academic performance, or to become successful in a sports activity.

- **Poverty**: People may turn to substances as a way to cope with financial hardship, hopelessness, or even emotional pain.

- **Violence**: Sometimes, physical and sexual abuse can leave a lasting trauma in people, especially from childhood. These people may begin using drugs to escape the painful memories.

- **Easy Access to Drugs:** Living in neighborhoods where drugs are readily available and where drug dealers or users are part of everyday life can raise the risk of early use of drugs and long-term dependence.

- **Lack of Education and Awareness**: Ignorance is a disease. Without proper health education, people may underestimate the risks of drug use or believe myths like “it’s just one time” or “it helps with stress.” This can subsequently lead to addiction.

## How differences in our brain response affect addiction.

Some people are more sensitive to the effects of certain drugs. When they use a substance like alcohol, their brain releases more dopamine, the “feel-good” chemical, than others. The pleasure they feel from the experience will, in turn, prompt repetition. Over time, the brain becomes dependent on the drug to feel normal, and food or relationships with people no longer feel satisfying. These persons tend to take more substances to satisfy the brain's cravings.

## Final thought – Management or prevention of addiction.

Addiction can be managed and prevented. To encourage recovery and prevention, we need to recognize that addiction is not only about weakness or environmental settings; it is a combination of genetics, mental health, and life circumstances. That is why some people become addicted faster than others, even when using the same substance. When we understand these risk factors, it can help in setting up effective recovery approach programs that involve families, schools, and communities for preventing or reducing drug use and many other forms of addiction.
