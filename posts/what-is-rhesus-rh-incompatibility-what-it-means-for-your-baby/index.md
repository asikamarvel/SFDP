Rhesus (Rh) factor incompatibility happens when an Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive fetus, and her immune system starts attacking the baby’s red blood cells, potentially leading to [hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9827520/). This condition is estimated [to affect 3 to 8 out of every 100,000 patients](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9827520/) yearly, cause stillbirths, and expose newborns to [hyperbilirubinemia](https://www.cureus.com/articles/60706-the-spectrum-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-newborn-evaluating-the-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-among-neonates-pertinent-to-immunohematological-workup#!/) (jaundice).

#### What is the Rhesus factor?

Red blood cells can carry a tiny antigen called the Rh factor on their surface. There are about five basic antigens of importance, which are [Rh (D), Rh (C), Rh (E), Rh (c), and Rh (e)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9827520/). Among them, [the Rh (D) antigen is the most immunogenic](https://www.blood.co.uk/why-give-blood/demand-for-different-blood-types/the-rh-system/). If you have this antigen, your blood group is “[Rh-positive](https://www.redcrossblood.org/local-homepage/news/article/what-is-the-rh-factor--why-is-it-important-.html)” (e.g., O+, A+, B+, AB+); if you do not have it, you are “[Rh-negative](https://www.redcrossblood.org/local-homepage/news/article/what-is-the-rh-factor--why-is-it-important-.html)” (e.g., O−, A−, B−, AB-).

Similar to the ABO blood group, Rh status is inherited from your parents. In everyday life, being Rh-positive or Rh-negative generally doesn’t affect your health; it is mostly important for pregnancy and blood transfusions.

#### How does Rh incompatibility develop?

Rh incompatibility happens when fetal red blood cells (RBCs) with the Rh-D antigen enter the bloodstream of an Rh-negative mother. The mother’s immune system sees these cells as foreign and responds by creating anti-D antibodies, a process called [alloimmunization or Rh sensitization](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4720943/). This is a natural immune response to protect the body.

##### **Rh incompatibility in blood transfusion**

In blood transfusion, individuals possessing the Rh-positive factor generally do not produce anti-Rh antibodies, rendering their blood highly compatible. On the other hand, Rh-negative individuals can produce these antibodies. This indicates that a person with Rh-positive blood can safely receive transfusions of both Rh-positive and Rh-negative blood, while people with Rh-negative blood typically can only receive Rh-negative blood. If an Rh-negative person receives Rh-positive blood, [the anti-Rh antibodies produced can cause transfusion complications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594252/).

##### Rh incompatibility in pregnancy

During pregnancy, complications can occur if an Rh-negative mother is carrying an Rh positive baby. In the first pregnancy, the initial immune response is usually mild and might not harm the baby. But in later pregnancies with another Rh-positive baby, the memory immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies can cross the placenta and bind to fetal RhD-positive red blood cells, [leading to destruction of fetal red blood cells](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4720943/).

Although this condition is largely preventable with an [anti-D (Rho(D) immune globulin)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557884/) injection given to Rh-negative mothers at specific times during pregnancy and after delivery, all pregnant women are also routinely tested to determine their blood group and Rh factor.

#### How Rh Incompatibility Affects the Baby

When maternal antibodies destroy fetal RBCs faster than they can be replaced, the fetus develops [hemolytic anemia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558904/). Severe, ongoing anemia can lead to heart failure, [generalized swelling (hydrops fetalis)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557423/), and even intrauterine fetal death in extreme cases.

After birth, continued breakdown of RBCs [releases large amounts of bilirubin, causing jaundice](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4720943/) and, if untreated, a risk of [kernicterus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559120/) and permanent brain damage. Affected newborns may require intensive treatment such as [phototherapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, simple transfusions, or exchange transfusions](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-neonate#Diagnosis_v1074187) to rapidly remove antibody-coated cells and excess bilirubin.

#### How Doctors Detect and Treat Rh Incompatibility

Early in pregnancy, the mother’s blood is tested to determine her blood group, Rh status, and whether any harmful antibodies are present. If she is Rh-negative, doctors may also check the father’s blood group. [If he is Rh-positive, there is a likelihood that the baby will also be Rh-positive](https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/quick-facts-women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/rh-incompatibility#Why-is-Rh-incompatibility-a-problem?_v28293544), and doctors will perform an ultrasound to check for signs of fetal anemia.

If the baby develops severe anemia before birth, doctors can perform a blood transfusion through the umbilical cord to stabilize the baby until delivery. [After birth, treatment focuses on quickly correcting anemia and jaundice](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn) and checking the baby for any ongoing blood problems or developmental issues.

#### Preventing Rh Disease: What Families and Health Systems Can Do

To prevent complications, Rh-negative pregnant women are given an injection called [Rho(D) immune globulin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557884/). It is usually administered around [26–28 weeks of pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557884/) and again [within 72 hours](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557884/) after delivering an Rh-positive baby. This injection is also recommended after events like [miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, certain prenatal procedures, abdominal injury, or bleeding in late pregnancy](https://www.fogsi.org/wp-content/uploads/tog/anti-d-immunoglobulin-2022.pdf), because these can mix the baby’s blood with themother’s. For public health, routine pregnancy blood tests, educating women about their blood group, and making sure Rh immunoglobulin is available can help prevent fetal and newborn deaths from Rh disease.
